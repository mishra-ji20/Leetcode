The way i submitted my first solution was too dumb because I had less confidence on my solution and didn't approached my first solution in depth.
​
​
Fisrt I thought of keeping  xor of the all the elemnts from 0 to n of string and check in hashmap which kept of records if the xor value has occured in the array with their  firstOccurence Index , I have assigned  xor value to  only vowels other than that all are 0
```
characterValue.put('a',2);
characterValue.put('e',4);
characterValue.put('i',8);
characterValue.put('o',16);
characterValue.put('u',32)
```
This was the best approach .
